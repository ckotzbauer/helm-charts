                                  If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array
                                  must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or
                                  DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This
                                  array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
                                items:
                                  type: string
                                type: array
                            required:
                            - key
                            - operator

                          additionalProperties:

                          description: matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs.
                            A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent
                            to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is
                            "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains
                            only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
